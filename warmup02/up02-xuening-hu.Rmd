#SUMMARY
##For all numeric vectors
###experience
```{r}
summary(experience)
```
###salary
```{r}
summary(salary)
```
###points
```{r}
summary(points)
summary(points1)
summary(points2)

```

#What are the typical values in each vector?
- mean  
- standard deviation  
- minimum value  
- maximum value  
- median  
- 1st and 3rd quartiles  

##Standard Deviation
```{r}
sd(salary)
sd(points)
sd(points1)
sd(points2)
sd(points3)
```
#What's the spread in each vector?
- the salary has a large standard deviation which means it has a large difference between the content numbers.
- the points3 has the smallest standard deviation among points, which means the content numbers are closed to the average and evenly.

#Graph
```{r}
hist(salary)
boxplot(salary)
```
#frequency table
```{r}
table(team)
```
#relative frequency table
```{r}
f.table=table(team)
rf.table=f.table/length(team)
```
#frequency Graph
```{r}
barplot(f.table)
barplot(rf.table)
```
#description of the graph
##What is the overall shape?
- the graph of the frequency of salary goes all way down. 
- the graph of the frequency of team has the same shape with the relative frequency table.
##What is the typical center?

##Overall range, along with an interval of typical measurements.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
