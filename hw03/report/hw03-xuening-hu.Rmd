#Ranking of Teams
##Basic Rankings
```{r}
ggplot(data = dat_teams,aes(x = reorder(team,salary), y = salary))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",colour = 'grey',alpha = 0.5)+
  labs(y = 'Salary (in millions)',x = 'Team',title = 'NBA Teams ranked by Total Salary')+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(dat_teams$salary),colour = "coral1", cex = 2.5,alpha = 0.9)

```
```{r}

```{r}
ggplot(dat_teams,aes(x = reorder(team,efficiency), y = efficiency))+
  geom_bar(colour = "grey", stat='identity',alpha = 0.5)+

 * If ranked by the total salary of the team, the first team is CLE and last PHI
 * If ranked by the total points of the team, the first team is GSW and last SAC
 * If ranked by the total points of the team, the first team is GSW and last SAC
 
#Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

```{r}
pca_teams <- select(dat_teams,points3,points2,free_throws,off_rebounds, def_rebounds, 
                    assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, fouls)

pca <- prcomp(pca_teams, scale = TRUE)

names(pca)

eigenvalue <- data.frame(
  eigenvalue = round(pca$sdev^2, 4),
  prop = round(pca$sdev ^ 2 / sum(pca$sdev ^ 2), 4),
  cumprop = cumsum(round(pca$sdev ^ 2 / sum(pca$sdev ^ 2), 4))
  )
eigenvalue

pca_x <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
pca_x[, "team"] <- dat_teams[, "team"]

ggplot(data = pca_x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2))  +
  geom_text(aes(label = pca_x$team))+
  labs(title = "PCA plot (PC1 and PC2)")

```

### Index based on PC1

```{r}
s1 <- 100 * (pca$x[, 1] - min(pca$x[, 1])) / (max(pca$x[, 1]) - min(pca$x[, 1]))
s1_table <- as.data.frame(s1)
s1_table[, "team"] = dat_teams[, "team"]

ggplot(data = s1_table, aes(x = reorder(s1_table$team, s1_table$s1), y = s1)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "identity",colour = 'grey',alpha = 0.5) +
 coord_flip() +
 ggtitle("NBA Teams ranked by scaled PC1") +
  xlab("Team") +
  ylab("First PC (scaled from 0 to 100)")

```

+ GSW ranks highest on the PC1 index, while SAC ranks lowest.
 
#Comments and Reflections

+ Was this your first time working on a project with such file structure? If yes, how do
you feel about it? \
 yes, it's my first time to work with PCA, I got lost on the fomular for a while.
+ Was this your first time using relative paths? If yes, can you tell why they are important
for reproducibility purposes? \
 no
+ Was this your first time using an R script? If yes, what do you think about just writing
code? \
 yes, it's not as convienence as RMD
+ What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab? \
 the PCA lets me struggle for a long while, and the graph reorder
+ What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab? \
 the graph and the prcomp
+ Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who? \
 yes, my GSI, Andy
+ Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who? \
 more than 6 hours
+ What was the most time consuming part? \
 PCA
+ Was there anything interesting?
 emmmmmmm........


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
