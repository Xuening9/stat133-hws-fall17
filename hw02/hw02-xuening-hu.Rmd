### Set up working directory for all chunks
```{r}
setwd("/Users/Xuening/STAT133/stat133-hws-fall17/hw02")
getwd()
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

```
##2)Import the data in R in two ways
```{r}

# with "base" read.csv()
dat1 <- read.csv('data/nba2017-player-statistics.csv')
str(dat1)
# with "readr" read_csv()
dat2 <- read_csv('data/nba2017-player-statistics.csv')
str(dat2)
```
##explicitly specify the data-type
###DAT1
```{r}
dat1 <- read.csv('data/nba2017-player-statistics.csv', 
 header = TRUE,
 colClasses=c("character",
              "character",
              "factor",
              "character",
              "double",
              rep("integer",19))
 )
str(dat1)
```
###DAT2
```{r}
dat2<- read_csv(
                'data/nba2017-player-statistics.csv',
                col_types = cols(
                  Player = col_character(),
                  Team = col_character(),
                  Position = col_factor(levels = c('C', 'PF', 'PG','SF', 'SG')),
                  Experience = col_character(),
                  Salary = col_double()
                )
)
str(dat2)
```
##3) Right after importing the data
```{r}

dat1$Experience[dat1$Experience == "R"] <- "0"
dat1$Experience <- as.integer(dat1$Experience)
str(dat1)

##OR

dat1$Experience_int = replace(dat1$Experience, dat1$Experience == "R", "0")
```
##4) Performance of players
```{r}
dat1$Missed_FG <- dat1$FGA - dat1$FGM
dat1$Missed_FT <- dat1$FTA - dat1$FTM
dat1$PTS <- dat1$Points3*3 + dat1$Points2*2 + dat1$FTM
dat1$REB <- dat1$OREB + dat1$DREB
dat1$MPG <-  dat1$MIN / dat1$GP
dat1$EFF = (dat1$PTS + dat1$REB + dat1$AST + dat1$STL + dat1$BLK - dat1$Missed_FG - dat1$Missed_FT - dat1$TO) / dat1$GP
summary(dat1$EFF)

```
##Barplot
```{r}
hist(dat1$EFF,
     breaks = 5,
     freq = TRUE,
     border = TRUE,
     xlim = c(-5,35),
     xlab = "EFF",
     ylab = "Frequency", 
     main = "Histogram of Efficiency (EFF)",
     axes = TRUE,
     col = "grey"
)
abline(h = 0)
```
##Display the player name, team, salary, and EFF value of the top-10 players by EFF in decreasing order (display this information in a data frame).
```{r}
EFF_de<- arrange(
  dat1,
  desc(EFF)
)
EFF_de[1:10,c("Player","Team","Salary","EFF")]

```


##Provide the names of the players that have a negative EFF.
```{r}
dat1[which(dat1[, "EFF"] < 0),"Player"]
```


##Use the function cor() to compute the correlation coefficients between EFF and all the variables used in the EFF formula.
```{r}
correlation1 <- data.frame(
  PTS = cor(dat1$EFF, dat1$PTS),
  REB = cor(dat1$EFF,dat1$REB),
  AST = cor(dat1$EFF,dat1$AST),
  STL = cor(dat1$EFF,dat1$STL),
  BLK = cor(dat1$EFF,dat1$BLK),
  Missed_FG = cor(dat1$EFF, -dat1$Missed_FG),
  Missed_FT = cor(dat1$EFF, -dat1$Missed_FT),
  TO = cor(dat1$EFF, -dat1$TO)
)
correlation1

```


##Notice that Missed_FG, Missed_FT, and TO contribute negatively to EFF, so make sure to take into account this negative association when calculating the correlation coefficients.
```{r}
correlation2 <- sort(correlation1,decreasing = TRUE)
```


##Display the computed correlations in descending order, either in a vector or a data frame. And create a barchart with the correlations (bars in decreasing order) like the one below.
```{r}
barplot(
  as.numeric(correlation2),
  ylim = c(-1,1),
  col = ifelse(correlation2[1,] >0,"grey","coral1"),
  main = "Correlations between Player Stats and EFF",
  cex.names = 0.6,
  border = NA,
  names.arg = colnames(correlation2)
)
abline(h =0)

```

##5) Efficiency and Salary

```{r}
player2 <- filter(dat1,dat1$MPG >=20)

player2

plot(player2$EFF, player2$Salary,ylab = "Salary", xlab = "Efficiency", xlim = c(),cex = 0.7, col = "grey", main = "scatterplot with lowess smooth")
lines(lowess(player2$EFF, player2$Salary,), lwd = 2.5, col = "red")

correlation3 <- cor(player2$EFF, player2$Salary)
correlation3

#They have the positive relationship
```
##6) Comments and Reflections
+ What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?\
  the graph part,correlation
+ What was easy(-ish) even though we haven¡¯t done it in class/lab?\
  sort/order,build data frame
+ Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help?\
  tutor on solving the errors
+ How much time did it take to complete this HW?\
  about 5 hours
+ What was the most time consuming part?\
  the plot graph part
+ Was there anything that you did not understand? or fully grasped?\
  correlation
+ Was there anything frustrating in particular?\
  when I saw error after I tried tones of times
+ Was there anything exciting? Something that you feel proud of? (Don¡¯t be shy, we won¡¯t tell anyone).\
  Yes, when I figure my error out.
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
